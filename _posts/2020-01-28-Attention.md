# Magic of attention
Why paying attention to your inner self or your sense of presence is magical? How is it different from paying attention to anything outside like a moving car, glowing light, etc?

Think of completing the circuit of a small bulb. Usually, in switched off condition one of the electrodes of the bulb is connected to a live source of electricity all the time. What switching the switch 'ON' does is that it connects the other electrode of the bulb to earth, therefore creating an exit path for the electrons and in the process, the circuits are completed and it flows through the filament of bulb and that creates illumination.
Now the same way your inner consciousness is connected to the universal consciousness all the time and when the attention is focussed outwards you can see all the objects of attention, therefore, creating your self world. The mind and memory play an important role and you are able to perceive the objects and things in the conformance of worldly life.
The moment you realize that the ability to be in the world and therefore perceiving the object is only because of the divine light within and the outside world is not real, the first thing you do is to switch off your mind and look for the reality, which is within and available here and now. Since its available here and now, the reality is ever fresh and hence you don't need any help from memory as well!
Those moments where your attention is focussed on real, outside world suddenly become blurry because your inner circuit is complete and glowing with the reality.

If this is practiced for a long time,  your tendency to see within is cemented and your attention is ever on the divine light within.
